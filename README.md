<h5>The notebooks liisutrate the basics of machine learning using <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Sklearn</a> and <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a>.</h5><br>
The first notbook is about spliting the data into training set and test set, creating a model using sklearn and keras, fitting the model to the data, and performance measurement. The applied model is linear regression. It also includes basic introdutcion to linear regression and its application in finance.<br><br>
The second notebook "dogs_cats_keras_CNN_transfer_learning_inceptionv3" implements CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) with transfer learning on the kaggle's Cats vs. Dogs. dataset. <br><br>
"NLP_tokenizing_embedding.ipynb" illustrates the preprocessing steps of NLP (Natural Language Processing) using keras.
"NLP_binary_classifier.ipynb" is a simple binary classification model of NLP using keras.
